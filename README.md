# Forest Fire Risk Dashboard

An interactive **Streamlit** application that visualizes a forest map with IoT sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.) and displays their data in real time.  
Every 5 minutes, the sensor metrics are updated and analyzed by two integrated AI models:  
- a **classifier** that evaluates whether there is a risk of wildfire,  
- a **regressor** that estimates the probability of a wildfire starting.  

This project combines **IoT, Data Science, and AI** into an intuitive dashboard to better understand and anticipate wildfire risks.
